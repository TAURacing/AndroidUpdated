AndroidUpdated
==============

Newly updated android interface


ADDED:
  NEW GUI USING GRID LAYOUT ALSO SUPPORTING LOWER ANDROID APIs.
TODO:
  ARRANGE EVERYTHING SO THAT IT PROVIDES A NICE HUMAN COMPUTER(PHONE) INTERACTION.
  IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONS TO HANDLE THE APPLICATION PROPERLY(when closed, paused....etc).
FUTURE IDEAS:
  MAKE DINAMICALLY AVAILABLE VIEWS FOR WHEN THE CAR IS NOT RUNNING -> DATA ANALYSIS?
IMPORTANT:
	IN ORDER FOR THE APPLICATION TO RUN ON THE SPECIFIED API LEVEL, THE GRID SUPPORT PROJECT LIBRARY NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE CLASSPATH. IT CAN BE DOWNLOADED THROUGH SDK.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING THE LIBRARY:
	FIRST DOWNLOAD THE V7 SUPPORT PACKAGE FROM THE SDK MANAGER.
	THEN GO TO YOUR-SDK-PATH/SDK/EXTRAS/ANDROID/SUPPORT/V7.
	YOU CAN COPY THE GRIDLAYOUT PROJECT TO ANOTHER LOCATION OR YOU CAN JUST USE THE ONE PROVIDED HERE.
	EITHER WAY OPEN ECLIPSE AND IMPORT THE ABOVE PROJECT MAKING SURE TO SET THE isLibrary TO TRUE -> TO DO THIS:RIGHT CLICK ON THE PROJECT->BUILD PATH->CONFIGURE BUILD PATH AND SELECET ANDROID FROM THE UPPER LEFT MENU
	THEN FOR THE CURRENT PROJECT GO TO BUILD PATH-> CONFIGURE BUILD PATH->ANDROID AND NOW JUST BELOW THE isLibrary box(dont select it this time) ADD A REFERENCE TO THE PROJECT WE IMPORTED FOR SUPPORT
	DONE.

AndroidUpdated
==============

Newly updated android interface


ADDED:
  NEW GUI USING GRID LAYOUT ALSO SUPPORTING LOWER ANDROID APIs.
TODO:
  ARRANGE EVERYTHING SO THAT IT PROVIDES A NICE HUMAN COMPUTER(PHONE) INTERACTION.
  IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONS TO HANDLE THE APPLICATION PROPERLY(when closed, paused....etc).
FUTURE IDEAS:
  MAKE DINAMICALLY AVAILABLE VIEWS FOR WHEN THE CAR IS NOT RUNNING -> DATA ANALYSIS?
IMPORTANT:
	IN ORDER FOR THE APPLICATION TO RUN ON THE SPECIFIED API LEVEL, THE GRID SUPPORT PROJECT LIBRARY NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE CLASSPATH. IT CAN BE DOWNLOADED THROUGH SDK.
